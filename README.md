# Predicting-loan-default-risk
XYZ Corp data focuses on  determining the risk associated with issuing loans to applicant customers.
Here I have first eliminated redundant attributes and then used machine learning algorithms to obtain a list of probable defaulters.  

Objective : To build a data model to predict the probability of default, and choose a
cut-off based on what you feel is suitable.
Based on the data that is available during loan application,I have built a model to predict default
in the future. This will help the company in deciding whether or not to pass the loan.
Also note that the data contains defaulters, successful payers and customers who were
current during that time. To simplify the problem, customers under successful payers ;current ; status have
been considered as non-defaulters in the dataset.

Steps followed :
1) Understanding the problem and objective 
2) Understanding the data and  to develop some business sense. 
3) EDA, segmentation .
4) Data Cleaning 
5) Feature engineering 
6) Model Building 
7) Testing and Cross-validation 
8) Final results, recommendations and plots/visualizations.
